Learned most things needed to use JS.
I will now learn how to use JS in Unity aand try to ake my own (mostly) bug free Zelda style game.
As always I will announce my progress.
I will not however link a download or show off any of it because my philosophy has always been not to rip off the wonderful devs of those games.

Wish me luck ^^
