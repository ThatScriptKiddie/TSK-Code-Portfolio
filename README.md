# TSK-Code-Portfolio
A compilation of all the code I write, even if it doesn't work.

I am learning how to code, and I will be using this to keep track of my progess.
Most of the code will be writen in JS, but if I do use something else I will say so in the title and/or the description.
NONE of this code should be used outside of checking my progress and the accuracy of my code.
My end goal is to be able to make games in Unity and Unreal using JS, Python, and C++.
