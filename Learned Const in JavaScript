//Learned how to use "Constant"
const Hamburger = 'Cheeseburger'
console.log(Hamburger)
const Big_Mac = 'Whopper'
console.log(Big_Mac)
//When ran, the console says Cheeseburger and Whopper

//Also, if you try to change what the const equals, the console will spit out errors lol
//Adding "Hamburger = 'Fries'" will spit out this error "error: Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable."

//I also learned to how to comment using double slashes
